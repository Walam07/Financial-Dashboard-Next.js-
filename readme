## \#\# Building for Mobile (Capacitor) üì±

To build the native mobile application, follow these steps after completing the initial setup.

1.  **Build the web assets:**
    This command creates a static version of your site in the `out` folder.

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

2.  **Sync the web assets with Capacitor:**
    This copies your web build into the native mobile platforms.

    ```bash
    yarn cap sync
    ```

3.  **Open the native project:**
    This will open the project in its respective IDE, where you can build and run it on an emulator or a physical device.

    **For Android:**

    ```bash
    yarn cap open android
    ```

    **For iOS** (requires macOS):

    ```bash
    yarn cap open ios
    ```
